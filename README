From the blog entry:

In my last entry about my Java Scheme implementation, 
"Peter Norvig created JScheme, a Lisp Scheme dialect written in Java. 
It was created in 1998 and it has since been forked, extended and 
used quite extensively in other modern projects for the web and elsewhere. 
I mention JScheme because the code I am about present is all 
based on the JScheme interpreter." Here is a description 
of the Erlang version of that implementation. A lot function 
names are the same as well as the logic used. Note: The approach 
used may not represent the Erlang best practices but there is 
a large correlation between the two versions. And so far, we 
have covered most of the Erlang idioms that will be used in 
our Mini Scheme implementation. If you are more familiar 
with imperative languages, you should be able to go back and 
forth between the Java and Erlang code.
